# THM Write-ups
Write-ups for my badly executed and solved THM Challenges.
As I am a beginner and I am still learning, I try to do write-ups for practice and reviewing my own, badly executed work. 
So use them at your own discretion. 
## Disclaimer about AI
Some Write-ups are created with the help of ChatGPT after I prompted my notes into it. 
#
Sometimes I asked ChatGPT how to perform certain actions (e.g. help me with a structured approach) or to help me with commands - as everyone does today.
#
My goal is to acutally learn a skill, not to copy-paste ChatGPT's commands. 
#
So I use ChatGPT as a resource and guide to explain the commands and not create commands that I don't understand (yet). Sadly, I have no one else.
#
I checked the write-ups afterwords to rule out hallucination and to let them represent my actual work.

Cheers
